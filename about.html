      JustTheRoutes was born in the heart of Kashmir — shaped not by trends,
      but by lived experiences. We grew up among these valleys, walked these
      trails, and listened to the stories that flow through Dal Lake and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, we saw travelers arrive with curiosity and leave with memories,
      but also with unanswered questions — about safety, authenticity, and trust.
      JustTheRoutes was created to change that.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe travel should feel personal. Every route we design is backed by
      local knowledge, verified partners, and a deep respect for Kashmir’s people
      and environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it’s a honeymoon, a family vacation, or a luxury escape, we treat
      every traveler as a guest in our home — because that’s how Kashmir has
      always welcomed the world.
