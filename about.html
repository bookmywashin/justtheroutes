<!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
<section class="section-white">
  <div class="container" style="max-width: 880px;">

    <p>
      JustTheRoutes was founded with a clear intention — to offer travel experiences in
      Kashmir that feel genuine, unhurried, and thoughtfully designed.
      We are a Kashmir-based travel company, built by locals who understand the land,
      its rhythms, and the responsibility that comes with welcoming travelers.
    </p>

    <p>
      For us, Kashmir is not a product or a seasonal destination.
      It is home. Every valley, road, and village carries stories we’ve grown up with.
      JustTheRoutes was created to share this deeper, more meaningful side of Kashmir
      with travelers who want more than surface-level sightseeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, we noticed a gap between what travelers hoped to experience
      and what they were often offered — rushed itineraries, unclear pricing,
      and generic routes that left little room for connection.
      We believed there was a better way to travel here.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to design journeys across Kashmir that are honest,
      safe, and deeply respectful of both travelers and local communities.
      We focus on creating experiences that balance comfort with exploration,
      and structure with flexibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      We aim to remove uncertainty from travel by offering transparent planning,
      reliable on-ground support, and itineraries that are tailored — not templated.
      Every route we recommend is one we trust ourselves.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">How We Work</h2>

    <p>
      Being based in Srinagar allows us to work directly with hotels, drivers,
      and guides we personally know and trust.
      This direct approach ensures consistent quality, fair pricing,
      and complete clarity for our travelers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We take time to understand who you are, how you prefer to travel,
      and what kind of experience you’re looking for.
      Whether it’s a short visit or an extended journey,
      our focus remains on thoughtful pacing and meaningful moments.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Responsible Travel</h2>

    <p>
      Kashmir’s beauty is timeless, but it is also fragile.
      We believe tourism should support local livelihoods
      while preserving the natural and cultural fabric of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      From accommodation choices to route planning,
      we encourage responsible travel practices that respect local traditions
      and minimize environmental impact.
      Safety and well-being remain central to every journey we plan.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Our Promise</h2>

    <p>
      When you travel with JustTheRoutes, you are choosing a team that values trust,
      transparency, and long-term relationships over quick transactions.
      We remain available throughout your journey and take responsibility
      for every detail we plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kashmir has its own pace and soul.
      Our promise is to help you experience it the right way —
      with care, clarity, and respect.
