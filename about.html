    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      JustTheRoutes was created with a simple belief —
      <strong>Kashmir should be experienced through the eyes of those who truly call it home.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not a generic travel company or a distant booking platform.
      We are locals, born and raised among these mountains, valleys, and lakes.
      Every route we design comes from lived experience, not brochures.
    </p>

    <h2>More Than a Destination</h2>
    <p>
      For us, Kashmir is not a checklist of attractions.
      It is home. Every winding road, hidden meadow, and sunrise over Dal Lake
      carries stories we’ve grown up with.
    </p>

    <p>
      JustTheRoutes exists to offer journeys that feel unhurried, personal,
      and deeply authentic — experiences that stay with you long after you return.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Do What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Traveling to Kashmir often comes with questions — safety, trust,
      transparency, and authenticity.
      As locals, we’ve seen travelers overwhelmed by rushed itineraries
      and impersonal packages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to change that.
      We design journeys that respect your pace,
      balance comfort with discovery,
      and offer complete clarity at every step.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Expertise. Real Experiences.</h2>
    <p>
      Being based in Srinagar gives us an unmatched advantage.
      We work directly with verified hotels, trusted drivers,
      and experienced local guides — many of whom we’ve known personally for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ensures fair pricing, consistent quality, and honest promises.
      No middlemen. No hidden costs. What you see is exactly what you experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsible & Safe Tourism</h2>
    <p>
      Kashmir’s beauty is timeless — and fragile.
      We believe tourism should uplift local communities
      while preserving nature and culture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Safety is central to everything we do.
      From route planning to accommodation selection,
      every detail is chosen with your comfort and peace of mind in focus.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      When you travel with JustTheRoutes,
      you are not just booking a tour —
      you are placing your trust in people who genuinely care.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Kashmir is timeless.<br>
      Let us show it to you — the right way.</strong>
