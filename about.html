  <h1>About JustTheRoutes</h1>

  <p>
    JustTheRoutes was born in the heart of Kashmir — not in a boardroom, but in
    the valleys, streets, and mountains we call home. Built by locals who have
    grown up listening to the stories of Dal Lake, walking through pine forests,
    and witnessing Kashmir through every season, we understand this land beyond
    guidebooks and maps.
  </p>

  <p>
    For us, travel is not about ticking destinations off a list. It’s about
    slowing down, connecting with people, and experiencing a place as it truly
    is. That philosophy lies at the core of everything we do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, we noticed that many travelers came to Kashmir with
    uncertainty — questions about safety, comfort, authenticity, and value.
    JustTheRoutes was created to answer those concerns with honesty, transparency,
    and genuine local care.
  </p>

  <p>
    We work closely with trusted drivers, verified hotels, and local partners to
    ensure every journey is safe, comfortable, and responsibly planned. Our
    itineraries are designed to respect local culture, protect natural beauty,
    and provide travelers with meaningful experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether it’s a couple on their honeymoon, a family creating lifelong
    memories, or a solo traveler seeking peace, we treat every guest as our own.
    Because when you travel with us, you’re not just a customer — you’re a
    guest in our home.
  </p>

  <p>
    JustTheRoutes is more than a travel company. It is our way of sharing the
    Kashmir we love — responsibly, safely, and wholeheartedly.
