    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      JustTheRoutes was born from a simple belief — that Kashmir should be experienced
      through the eyes of those who truly know it. We are not just a travel company;
      we are locals who grew up among these mountains, valleys, and lakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      For us, Kashmir is not a destination on a map. It is home. Every winding road,
      every hidden meadow, every sunrise over Dal Lake carries memories and meaning.
      JustTheRoutes was created to share this authentic Kashmir with travelers who
      seek more than surface-level sightseeing.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Do What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Travel to Kashmir often comes with questions — about safety, authenticity,
      transparency, and trust. As locals, we understood these concerns deeply.
      We saw travelers overwhelmed by generic packages, rushed itineraries,
      and impersonal experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to change that narrative. We design journeys that are unhurried,
      well-planned, and deeply personal. Every route we create is thoughtfully curated
      to balance comfort, discovery, and cultural connection.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Expertise, Real Experiences</h2>
    <p>
      Being based in Srinagar gives us an unmatched advantage. We work directly with
      verified hotels, trusted drivers, and local guides — many of whom we have known
      personally for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      This allows us to ensure fair pricing, consistent quality, and complete
      transparency. There are no middlemen, no inflated costs, and no false promises.
      What you see is exactly what you experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsible & Safe Tourism</h2>
    <p>
      Kashmir’s beauty is fragile, and we believe tourism should uplift local
      communities while preserving nature. We promote responsible travel practices
      that respect the environment, local culture, and traditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Safety is at the heart of everything we do. From route planning to accommodation
      selection, every detail is chosen with traveler security and comfort in mind.
      Our team remains available throughout your journey to ensure peace of mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      When you travel with JustTheRoutes, you are not just booking a tour —
      you are placing your trust in people who genuinely care about your experience.
      We promise honesty, warmth, and journeys that stay with you long after you return.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kashmir is timeless. Let us show it to you the right way.
